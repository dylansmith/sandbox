# The American Flag in CSS

This was one of the best things I've ever been asked in an interview - to semantically markup the American flag in HTML and render it visually using CSS only (no special fonts, images, etc). The exercise went on to include linking each star and stripe to a detail page, server-side request handling, and the intricacies of HTTP.

It is a challenging problem to give someone on the spot, and so it took the form of a discussion rather than a "developer test". The interviewers were more interested in the thinking that went into the solution than the solution itself, which I think is an excellent approach.

This is my solution to the markup & CSS aspects of the exercise.
